# Calculator - A Python Library

## About 

A well-known programming language's Repo **"Python"** containing the known knowledge of Fundamentals of General requirement of a Calculator with different units of our environmental needs.

## Available Categories in Repo

- **BMI** - Contains different methods regarding calcutions on BMI [Body Mass Index].
- **Data Units** - Units that we generall used to find in storage units like MB,GB,TB,.. and so on.
- **Discount** - Units regarding the calculations of different discounts while you used to shop.
- **Length** - Units that are used to get into the distance countable like CM,MM,DM,..and so on.
- **Temperature** - Units that are useful regarding calculations of temperature in different degrees.
- **Time** - Units regarding time and its conversions to get simply used further.
- **Volume** - Units regarding calculations of different quantities of volumes.
- **Weight** - Units related to different quantities of weights.

## Brief Explanation of Units

### BMI Methods

| **Methods** | **Uses** |
| ----------- | -------- |
| **heightinch()** | Used in order to calculate BMI after passing the height in inch |
| **heightmtr()** | Used to get the BMI after passing height in Meters |
| **heightcm()** | Used to get BMI after passing the height in CentiMeter |
| **heightfoot()** | Used in order to calculate BMI after passing the height in foot |

Note : Further code and data element is given in [BMI](https://github.com/ackwolver335/Calculator/blob/main/BMI.py) file.

### Data Module's Methods

It contains methods regarding the conversions in units of storage devices like bit,bytes,KB,.. and so on. Due to which one of them is shown in order to have an idea of this particular module.

| **Methods** | **Uses** | **Methods** | **Uses** |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **bt2byte()** | Conversion of Bit to Byte | **byt2bt()** | Conversion of Byte to Bit |
| **bt2kb()** | Conversion of Bit to KB | **byt2kb()** | Conversion of Byte to KB |
| **bt2mb()** | Conversion of Bit to MB | **byt2mb()** | Conversion of Byte to MB |
| **bt2gb()** | Conversion of Bit to GB | **byt2gb()** | Conversion of Byte to GB |
| **bt2tb()** | Conversion of Bit to TB | **byt2tb()** | Conversion of Byte to TB |
| **bt2pb()** | Conversion of Bit to PB | **byt2pb()** | Conversion of Byte to PB |
| **bt2eb()** | Conversion of Bit to EB | **byt2eb()** | Conversion of Byte to EB |
| **bt2zb()** | Conversion of Bit to ZB | **byt2zb()** | Conversion of Byte to ZB |
| **bt2yb()** | Conversion of Bit to YB | **byt2yb()** | Conversion of Byte to YB |

Note : In this similar way other data units are given in [Data](https://github.com/ackwolver335/Calculator/blob/main/Data.py) file.

### Discount Module

A Module containing simply one method in order to work on just calculating one discount not on other else things.

Note : File is available with name [Discount](https://github.com/ackwolver335/Calculator/blob/main/Discount.py)

### Length Module

It contains different units that can be considered both in minor and major categories. Cause of availability of more than one unit's category, we have the explanation on one to be considered with others.

| **Methods** | **Uses** | **Methods** | **Uses** |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **km2meter()** | Covnersion of km to mtr | **m2km()** | Convesion of mtr to km |
| **km2dm()** | Conversion of km to dm | **m2cm()** | Conversion of mtr to cm |
| **km2cm()** | Conversion of km to cm | **m2dm()** | Conversion of mtr to dm |
| **km2mm()** | Conversion of km to um | **m2mm()** | Conversion of mtr to mm |
| **km2nm()** | Conversion of km to nm | **m2um()** | Conversion of mtr to um |
| **km2pm()** | Conversion of km to pm | **m2nm()** | Conversion of mtr to nm |
| **km2miles()** | Conversion of km to miles | **m2pm()** | Conversion of mtr to pm |
| **km2foot()** | Conversion of km to foot | **m2miles()** | Conversion of mtr to miles |
| **km2yard()** | Conversion of km to yard | **m2yard()** | Conversion of mtr to yard |
| **km2inches()** | Conversion of km to inches | **m2foot()** | Conversion of mtr to foot |

Note : In the similar way other distance units at micro and macro level are available in [Length](https://github.com/ackwolver335/Calculator/blob/main/Length.py) file.
